The goal of this challenge is to assess how you resolve vulnerabilities within a docker image.The dockerfile builds into a docker image that contains the following vulnerabilities.

    CVE-2018-18074
      This vulnerability pertains to the dependency for "requests" and is classified as Information Exposure. Upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, it sends the HTTP Authorization header to an http URI. This makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network. NVD (National Vulnerability Database) states that this vulnerability affects Requests package before 2.20.0. We can see in the requirements.txt file that the version is "requests==2.19.0". Updating the version to 2.20.0 will remediate this vulnerability.

    CVE-2018-100517
      I wasn't able to find "CVE-2018-100517", but I was able to find "CVE-2018-1000517" which relates to the BusyBox wget version that has a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. I didn't see BusyBox being called in the Dockerfile, but after looking in the "http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main/" repository, BusyBox is listed and added to the system. This could be remediated by excluding BusyBox, removing it, or replacing it with the real wget package. Another solution could also be to add the latest-stable repository to the dockerfile which uses Busybox version 1.32.1 instead of <vulnerable version>.

    CVE-2018-12699
      This vulnerability relates to the finish_stab in stabs.c in GNU Binutils 2.30 that can lead to a denial of service. Binutils version 2.35.2 is currently listed in the repositories (not sure where the vulnerability is coming from).
