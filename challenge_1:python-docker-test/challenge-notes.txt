      This vulnerability pertains to the dependency for "requests" and is classified as Information Exposure. Upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, it sends the HTTP Authorization header to an http URI. This makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network. NVD (National Vulnerability Database) states that this vulnerability affects Requests package before 2.20.0. We can see in the requirements.txt file that the version is "requests==2.19.0". Updating the version to 2.20.0 will remediate this vulnerability.
