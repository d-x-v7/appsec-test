The goal of this challenge is to assess how you resolve vulnerabilities within a docker image.The dockerfile builds into a docker image that contains the following vulnerabilities.

    CVE-2018-18074
      This vulnerability pertains to the dependency for "requests" and is classified as Information Exposure. Upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, it sends the HTTP Authorization header to an http URI. This makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network. NVD (National Vulnerability Database) states that this vulnerability affects Requests package before 2.20.0. We can see in the requirements.txt file that the version is "requests==2.19.0". Updating the version to 2.20.0 will remediate this vulnerability.

    CVE-2018-100517
      I wasn't able to find "CVE-2018-100517", but I was able to find "CVE-2018-1000517" which relates to the BusyBox wget version that has a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. I didn't see BusyBox being called in the Dockerfile or requirements.txt, but BusyBox is included in the "http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main/" repository. Although the vulnerable version of BusyBox is listed as 1.27.2-2 and fixed in 1:1.27.2-3; the version present in the repository is 1.33.0*, so it should be remediated. But to be safe, we can include the "--update add busybox" to the dockerfile, which will install the most recent version of it.

    CVE-2018-12699
      This vulnerability relates to the finish_stab in stabs.c in GNU Binutils 2.30 that can lead to a denial of service. Binutils version 2.35.2 is currently listed in the repositories, but exists in alpine 3.8. Simply building apline version 3.9 instead of 3.8 would likely alleviate this vulnerability.
